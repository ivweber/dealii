TO DO:
Update comments to correctly use deal.II (and Doxygen where needed) in files:
	fe_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if needed)

Add explanation as a comment to dofs/dof_tools_sparsity.cc explaining changes
Break quotation-style strings into separate lines where needed, using automatic concatenation in C++
Rewrite project functions with different name
Check if reverting to MappingCartesian is possible to remove need for new mapping class
Move project functions to include/deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h, add note
Move project boundary functions to include/deal.II/numerics/vector_tools_boundary.h, add note

Update tests for any changes made to code (different polynomial name, MappingCartesian instead of MappingHermite, etc) and check they work
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc





COMPLETE:
add license details to files:
	polynomials_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.h
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.cc
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	mapping_hermite.inst.in (if mapping is still needed)
	wave_solver_hermite.cc
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc
	
Add whitespace to files:
	polynomials_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.h
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.inst.in (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	wave_solver_hermite.cc
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc

Update comments to deal.II (also Doxygen when needed) format in files:
	wave_solver_hermite.cc
	fe_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if needed)
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc
	polynomials_hermite.h
	
Update instantiations to use automatic for loops (current implementation is large and unwieldy):
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	mapping_hermite.inst.in

Remove notes subdirectory from pull request
Remove deeploop.h from pull request
Put factorial function in polynomials_hermite into internal namespace
Remove fe_values from pull request
Consider removing custom Hermite option for initial pull request
	Split into separate source code files for normal Hermite and custom regularity, only pull request normal Hermite files
Remove unused grid refinement functionality
Remove mapping_hermite_* labels from fe/mapping.h to avoid complications
Remove commented out functions
