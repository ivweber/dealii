TO DO:	
Add license details to files:
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc
	
Add whitespace to files:
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc
	
Update comments to correctly use Doxygen in files:
	polynomials_hermite.h
	fe_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if needed)
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	fe_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if needed)
	shapes_hermite.cc
	derivatives.h
	derivatives_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite.cc
	uneven_1d_grid_hermite_laplace.cc
	2d_grid_projection_hermite.cc
	project_boundaries_hermite.cc
	wave_solver_hermite.cc

Remove commented out functions
Remove unused grid refinement functionality
Remove mapping_hermite_* labels from fe/mapping.h to avoid complications
Add explanation as a comment to dofs/dof_tools_sparsity.cc explaining changes
Break quotation lines into separate lines where needed, using automatic concatenation in C++
Rewrite project functions with different name
Check if reverting to MappingCartesian is possible to remove need for new mapping class
Update tests for any changes made to code (different polynomial name, MappingCartesian instead of MappingHermite, etc)
Move project functions to include/deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h, add note
Move project boundary functions to include/deal.II/numerics/vector_tools_boundary.h, add note





COMPLETE:
add license details to files:
	polynomials_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.h
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.cc
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	mapping_hermite.inst.in (if mapping is still needed)
	wave_solver_hermite.cc
	
Add whitespace to files:
	polynomials_hermite.h
	mapping_hermite.h (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.h
	polynomials_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.cc (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.cc
	mapping_hermite.inst.in (if mapping is still needed)
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	wave_solver_hermite.cc

Update comments to Doxygen format in files:
	
Update instantiations to use automatic for loops (current implementation is large and unwieldy):
	fe_hermite.inst.in
	mapping_hermite.inst.in

Remove notes subdirectory from pull request
Remove deeploop.h from pull request
Put factorial function in polynomials_hermite into internal namespace
Remove fe_values from pull request
Consider removing custom Hermite option for initial pull request
	Split into separate source code files for normal Hermite and custom regularity, only pull request normal Hermite files
