Changed: Several parts of the library involve interfacing with
external libraries by way of user-defined callback functions. Specific
examples are the interfaces to the SUNDIALS solvers (e.g., the
SUNDIALS::KINSOL class). These interfaces typically required using the
convention for error reporting defined by the underlying library -- in
the case of SUNDIALS, for example, callbacks needed to return zero in
case of success, a negative value for an irrecoverable error, and a
positive value for a recoverable error.

This approach does not scale across the many interfaces we have. As a
consequence, we standardized how callbacks should behave, as
documented in @ref GlossUserProvidedCallBack "this glossary entry".
The interfaces in SUNDIALS::KINSOL and SUNDIALS::ARKode have been
changed correspondingly.
