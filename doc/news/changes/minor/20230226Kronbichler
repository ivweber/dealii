Fixed: SolverCG used with matrices and preconditioners that support
interleaving of the vector updates with the matrix-vector product (e.g. with
certain matrix-free operators) sometimes performed the final update to the
result vector `x` with a wrong coefficient. This could affect the returned
solution for coarse tolerances far away from convergence. This is now fixed.
