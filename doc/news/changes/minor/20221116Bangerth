Changed: The constructors of the various solver classes in the PETScWrappers namespace
used to take an `MPI_Comm` argument. This has now been changed: There
is a new set of constructors that no longer take this argument, and
the old constructors have been deprecated. In practice, the solvers
now use the same MPI communicator as the matrix give to the `solve()`
function.
