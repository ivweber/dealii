Fixed: Mesh files in COMSOL's `.mphtxt` format are often created on
Windows and then read using deal.II on Unix. Windows uses a different
line ending style than Linux, and this led to error messages that were
impossible to understand because the different line ending style is
not visible in most editors. This is now fixed: The
GridIn::read_comsol_mphtxt() function also accepts Windows line
endings.
