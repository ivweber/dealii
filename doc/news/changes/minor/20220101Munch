Improved: The class PreconditionRelaxation has been refactored.
Similarly to PreconditionChebyshev, it can be now used
stand-alone and users can attach their own preconditioners.
Furthermore, users can specify multiple iteration steps, 
which is particularly useful if PreconditionRelaxation is 
used as smoother in a multigrid algorithm.
