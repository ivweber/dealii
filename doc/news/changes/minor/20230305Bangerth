Fixed: It was previously possible to assign scalar values to
Tensor and VectorizedArray objects that were temporaries -- say in expressions
such as
```
  VectorizedArray<...> my_function();
  ...
  my_function() = 1.234;
```
This does not make any sense: What `my_function()` returns is a
temporary object, and assigning a value to it has no consequences
because the temporary object dies at the end of the line. Whatever the
programmer intended to do here was almost certainly a mistake.

As a consequence, this is now prohibited and the compiler will produce
an error when trying to do this.
