Fixed: Consider the following scenario: You initialize a DoFHandler with a
parallel::distributed::Triangulation, and afterwards you want to create the
Triangulation by calling Triangulation::create_triangulation() that takes a
TriangulationDescription::Description as an argument. This caused an issue
as the active FE tables of the DoFHandler have not been properly updated
during the creation of the Triangulation. This is fixed now by treating the
resulting Triangultion as a 'fresh' one by triggering Triangulation::Signals::create
at the end of Triangulation::create_triangulation(), which in turn
reinitializes the DoFHandler.
