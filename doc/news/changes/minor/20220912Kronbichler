Improved: The vector operations in SolverIDR::solve() have been revised for
performance.  The new implementation should show a speedup in case the
matrix-vector product and preconditioner are not much more expensive than the
vector operations. Furthermore, the usage of temporary vectors has been
reduced by two.
