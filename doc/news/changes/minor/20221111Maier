Workaround: The testsuite CMake macros now generate a top-level target
compile_test_executables in user projects that can be used to force the
compilation of all test executables. This works around an issue with the
ninja build system that concurrent invocation of tests
(via <code>ctest -jN</code>) that build executables will fail when calling
back into cmake. As a workaround it is now possible to first build all
executables first via <code>ninja compile_test_executables</code> and then
run tests in parallel with <code>ctest -jN</code>.
