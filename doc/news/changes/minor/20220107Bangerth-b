Changed: The step-43 tutorial program used `Amg_preconditioner` and
`Mp_preconditioner` to denote the preconditioners for the top left and
bottom right block of a mixed-Laplace matrix. These variable names
were taken from step-31/step-32 where they made sense, but in the
current context, the names do not reflect what is in the corresponding
matrix blocks. They have been renamed to `top_left_preconditioner` and
`bottom_right_preconditioner`, respectively.
