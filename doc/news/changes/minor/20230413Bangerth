Fixed: In FEInterfaceValues::reinit(), if `q_index` is not explicitly
given but none of the two adjacent elements dominates the other, one
used to get a rather obscure error. The error now produced points at
the actual problem, and a much expanded discussion of what is going
wrong is provided in the documentation of the function.
