Updated: deal.II no longer exports the -fPIC/-fpic compiler flags for
compiling relocatable, position independent code. This should have minimal
impact on user projects because CMake is handling the -fPIC/-fpic
automatically. But for some less common scenarios in user projects (e.g.,
object targets) it might be necessary to set the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
target property in CMake.
